# Chess Reinforcement Learning Project

This repository contains several modules that together form a chess reinforcement learning environment, leveraging various strategies and APIs to simulate and learn from chess games.

## Modules

### `opponent_agent.py`

- **Description**: This module defines an agent that acts as the opponent in chess games. It uses predefined strategies or external APIs to make decisions.

### `rl_agent.py`

- **Description**: Implements the reinforcement learning agent. This agent learns from interactions with the environment and improves its decision-making capabilities over time.

### `state_representation.py`

- **Description**: Provides functions to represent the chess game state in a format suitable for processing by machine learning models.

### `stock_fish_api.py`

- **Description**: Interfaces with the Stockfish chess engine API, enabling the reinforcement learning agent to query optimal moves under certain game states.

### `train.py`

- **Description**: Orchestrates the training process of the reinforcement learning agent by setting up game simulations, updating the agentâ€™s state, and adjusting its learning parameters.
